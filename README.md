This repository can be used as a starting point for creating new features and 
enhancements in [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) by the means 
of free community discussion.

Ideas can be freely shared and discussed by [opening issues](https://github.com/Xrayez/godot-ideas/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=idea-proposal.md&title=) in this repository and
contributing to the existing ones. Once an idea is considered complete on a conceptual 
level and there's enough community interest, you can decide whether it's worth to 
make an official and formal proposal to [godot-proposals](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals)
repository for it to be implemented in Godot Engine by the core contributors or
interested volunteers.

#### Guides for Submitting an Idea

* There's a template for you to fill with the questions which reflect the ones in 
the [godot-proposals](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals) repository, 
but they are optional and you are free to express your idea in any form regardless.

* Start small, and if you see that the idea starts to gain more interest by the 
community, keep developing the idea until it's complete on a conceptual level by
editing the original post.

* The idea can be linked to a real use-case, project, problem, task, obstacle, 
goal etc. Features that are "need-to-have" are as welcomed as "nice-to-have" here.

* You are free to draw interest to your proposed idea by reaching out on the 
community channels if you expect it to be approved and further implemented 
in Godot Engine core, see [Community Channels](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/community/channels.html).

#### Guides for Submitting an Idea as an Official Proposal

* Refer to [official instructions](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/blob/master/README.md).

* If the idea can be implemented as a plugin or a module, it's unlikely that
the Godot maintainers are going to accept the proposal. If that's the case, you 
can at least hope that someone with enough skills can implement your idea as 
a separate, independent solution.
