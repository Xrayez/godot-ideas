### *Disclaimer*

*If you want to suggest an idea which can be reviewed and implemented by core
developers to be present directly in [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/), 
please refer to official [godot-proposals](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals) 
repository and instructions. This repository cannot be seen as an official place 
to propose and discuss ideas.*

## Description

This repository can be used to share and discuss ideas regarding module and plugin 
development by the means of free community discussion, but also to potentially 
discuss possible problems and hurdles associated with the engine which might be 
controversial in nature.

Ideas can be freely shared and discussed by 
[opening issues](https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/godot-ideas/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=idea-discussion.md&title=) 
in this repository and contributing to the existing ones. Features that are 
"nice-to-have" are as welcomed as "need-to-have", so please don't hesitate 
to share your thoughts.
