Godot Ideas
===========

### *Disclaimer*

*If you want to suggest an idea which can be reviewed and implemented by core
developers to be present directly in [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/),
please refer to official
[godot-proposals](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals) repository and
instructions. This repository cannot be seen as an official place to propose and
discuss ideas.*

## Description

This repository can be used to share and discuss ideas regarding module and
plugin development by the means of free community discussion, but also to
potentially discuss possible problems and hurdles associated with the engine
which might be controversial in nature.

Ideas can be freely shared and discussed by
[opening a new discussion](https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/godot-ideas/discussions/new)
in this repository and contributing to existing ones. Features that are
"nice-to-have" are as welcomed as "need-to-have", so please don't hesitate to
share your thoughts.

If you'd like to create a tracker for existing proposals and/or issues, please
[open a new issue](https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/godot-ideas/issues/new/)
instead.
